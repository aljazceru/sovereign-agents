### What are sovereign agents
Sovereign agents are extension of a sovereign individual, expanding his capabilities and augmenting his intelect. 

### Guiding principles for sovereign agents are:
- they preserve the individuals privacy
- they support the individuals goals
- they save the individuals time
- they enhance the individuals productivity
- they enable the individuals sovereignity

### How sovereign agents operate
Currently primary modality of how people interact with any "AI" is by requesting things from it. But this is merely a crutch. Sovereign agent could be a guard dog for its owner's attention and time, proactively gathering and processing infromation on behalf of its owner, filtering out and summarizing the relevant and discarding the noise. And push the relevant to the owner instead of waiting for the owner to figure out it needs it. 

### Functions that sovereign agents could do:
- news aggregation and preparation of daily summaries based on interests
- email and other communication filtering, automated responding acting as a narrow executive assistant
- perform simple tasks
  - web research
  - copywriting
  - market research
- write code (and execute it)
- autonomously perform tasks (at some point)

### Building blocks for Sovereign Agents
- convert text to speech
- convert speech to text
- text to image generation
- image to text recognition
- image manipulation
- conversational LLM
- personal context through RAG
- access to vast pools of information
- confidential computing
- open and interoperable approach to building

### How do we build them
#### implementing reusable building blocks using holon philosophy, making each of them usable by themselves and as a part of a larger system
- every holon is a standalone data vending machine, thus immediately useful
- by embracing DVM's sovereign agents instantly get all the abilities of all DVMs out there
- easily reusable confidential computing playbooks and prepared containers for developers to start creating software that can run in enclaves
#### focusing upfront on making the participation of other interested parties as smooth as possible
- extensive documentation and development tooling to enable rapid experimentation
- ensuring minimal non-breakable communication standards between holons to prevent breaking changes and friction in the process
- making scratching your own its trivially simple
#### embracing our weakness
- sovereign agents are not a commercial product but an implementation proposal of distributed agents for sovereign individuals and thus don't care about controling every aspect of the experience but instead embracing chaos 
- horizontal distribution and interoperability can far outweight lack of vertical integaration on the long run
